# pas2-cli-args

Parse explicit long-option command-line schemas.

Part of **Pas2 Kit** by [1Pas2](https://github.com/1Pas2): small independent TypeScript libraries with no runtime dependencies.

## Features

- Focused API with strict TypeScript declarations.
- ESM package for Node.js 22 and later.
- Automated behavioral tests and CI on Node.js 22 and 24.

## Installation

This package is prepared for npm but is **not published to npm**. Install from a local checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1Pas2/pas2-cli-args.git
cd pas2-cli-args
npm ci
npm run build
npm pack
```

Install the resulting `.tgz` in your application using `npm install /path/to/package.tgz`.
The intended npm name is `@1pas2/cli-args`; registry availability is not claimed.

## Usage

```ts
import { parseArgs } from '@1pas2/cli-args';
console.log(parseArgs(['--name=demo','--verbose','file.txt'], {name:'string',verbose:'boolean'}));
```

The checked-in example imports the local build. After building, run it with `node --experimental-strip-types examples/basic.ts` on a compatible Node.js release. Network and filesystem examples perform the operations shown.

## API and behavior

parseArgs(args,schema) supports --key value, --key=value, boolean --flag and --flag=false, plus the -- terminator. Repeated options keep the last value. Unknown options and missing values throw. Short options are treated as positionals; no aliases or combined flags.

The complete public types are in [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) and generated in `dist/index.d.ts`.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run check:examples
npm pack --dry-run
```

Tests use the built-in Node.js test runner against the compiled public API. Runtime dependencies: none. Development dependencies: TypeScript and Node.js type declarations. This initial release has a deliberately small scope; review its documented limits before production use.
